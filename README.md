# Autonomous Vehicles Capstone: Odometry and IMU 

We are Team 4 in the Autonomous Vehicles Data Science Capstone Project. Our project revolves around the IMU, Odometry efforts while we collectively work to build a 1/5 scale racing autonomous vehicle. The goal for our project was to calibrate, tune, and analyze Odometry and IMU data to obtain the most accurate position estimate, compass heading, and data readings to support the other subteams that would utilize these measurements in the navigation stack.

For this project we will be using the F110th Odometry files to gather odometry data using our robot car and integrating, calibrating, and verifying the OpenLog Artemis IMU for our project.

Developed by: Pranav Deshmane and Sally Poon

### Usage

```
python run.py <target>
```
The Targets are: 
 
* conversion - This will extract the data from the raw ROS bags, clean them, and convert them to csv files to be analyzed
 
* viz_analysis - This will run the visualizations used in our analysis for IMU and Odometry calibration, tuning, and testing

* test - This will test the conversion and visualization process with sample data chosen from our raw data
