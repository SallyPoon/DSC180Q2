We are Team 4 in the Autonomous Vehicles Data Science Capstone Project. Our project revolves around the IMU, Odometry efforts while we collectively work to build a 1/5 scale racing autonomous vehicle.

Developed by: Pranav Deshmane and Sally Poo

For this project we will be using the F110th Odometry files to gather odometry data using our robot car and integrating, calibrating, and verifying the OpenLog Artemis IMU for our project.

### Responsibilities 

* Sally developed Odometry.ipynb, run.py, eda.py, conversion.py
* Pranav developed Readme, run.py, test.py, IMU.ipynb
